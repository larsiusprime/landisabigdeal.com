#Pre-Publication praise for "Land is a Big Deal"

> The Georgists talk about their own movement in terms of "seeing the cat" - realizing the degree to which land affects the economy is a sudden perspective shift, surprising and irreversible. Lars' entry in my book review contest caused thousands of people to see the cat at once. It ended up getting 114,000 views, being shared hundreds times on Twitter (an archaic social media site sort of like voluntarily subjecting yourself to painful electric shocks, but more addictive), and inspiring a renewal of interest in Georgist ideas whose full ramifications are yet to be determined. One of those ramifications is this book.
- Scott Alexander

> Lars's work is intellectually fascinating and among the clearest and most compelling writing in support of land value taxes that I've seen
- Vitalik Buterin

> A really excellent overview of land wealth in America
- Noah Smith

> An absolutely wonderful summary of the economics of Henry George and land value taxes. Comprehensive but accessible, and above all fun!
– Rethinking Economics

> Why land matters more today than ever… and why economists, urbanists & everyone else need to take Henry George Seriously
– Richard Florida, co-founder of Bloomberg CityLab 

> Take the Georgist pill and read this 
– Arpit Gupta, author of Arpitrage newsletter

> Have you seen the cat? Whether or not Doucet converts you to Georgism, you’ll come away with a new appreciation for how every economic system is built on the same resource: land."
