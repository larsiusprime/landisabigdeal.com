<h1>Action Plan & Research</h1>

<p>
What comes next after writing <i>Land is a Big Deal</i>? Putting together a comprehensive and credible plan for moving towards Land Value Tax policies in the United States and the rest of the world, of course.
</p>

<p>
But how do we actually achieve this in practice? Aren't there a host of political obstacles? Isn't the U.S. congress perpetually stuck in partisan gridlock where almost nothing gets done? How could it ever get done?
</p>

<p>
The same way most successful political movements get off the ground: bottom-up, not top-down.

<h2>Revenue-Neutral Property Tax Shift to Land</h2>

<p>
The best immediate policy to achieve our goals is to leverage existing systems and push for split-rate property tax policies that allow local municipalities to tax land and buildings at separate rates. Crucially, the *exact same amount of property tax* will be collected, the only difference being what exactly is being taxed. We favor eliminating taxes on buildings entirely, moving the full burden of taxation onto unimproved land value, but any shift that moves the needle towards land is an improvement over the status quo.
</p>

<p>
A revenue-neutral property tax shift to land has the following advantages:
<ul>
  <li>It leverages existing political and taxing structure</li>
  <li>It is no more expensive or difficult to adminster than the status quo</li>
  <li>It is a modest change that has immediate measurable benefits</li>
</ul>
The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has studied this in great detail in a recent report and tells us:
<blockquote>
Three technical papers produced for this study cover subjects of central importance to the City of Detroit:
tax delinquency, business formation, and property value effects.<br><br>
First, analysis of Detroitâ€™s recent reassessment shows that tax foreclosures are reduced significantly when
effective tax rates on residential properties are lowered. Furthermore, current-year delinquency rates are
reduced, and homeownership rates increase.<br><br>
Second, an analysis of Pennsylvania municipalities that adopted split-rate tax systems shows a sizable,
statistically meaningful, and immediate increase in the number of business establishments within those
municipalities.<br><br>
Finally, the experience of Pennsylvania municipalities suggests that there is a statistically significant,
positive effect on real property market values after initial implementation, with modest declines in land
values offset by increases in the value of structures.
